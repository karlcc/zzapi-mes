# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

zzapi-mes is an SAP ICF REST handler SDK + CLI for MES integration on **SAP_BASIS 700**. The core architectural decision ("Strategy D") is to implement new API endpoints as ABAP classes implementing `IF_HTTP_EXTENSION` and registered via transaction SICF — **deliberately avoiding BSP pages, SE80, and page-attribute/flow-logic plumbing**. Full rationale: `docs/demo-walkthrough.md` and the Obsidian note `zzapi-mes-strategy-d-icf-handler-deep-study.md`.

The existing BSP page `ZMES001.htm` stays as-is; all **new** endpoints go through the ICF handler pattern.

## Repo Layout

- `abap/` — ABAP class source mirrored from SE24. These files are the source of truth in git, but the *running* code lives on the SAP system. They are not "compiled" locally.
- `scripts/smoke.sh` — curl round-trip tests against the deployed handlers on `sapdev.fastcell.hk:8000`. Supports direct and hub mode (`HUB_MODE=1`).
- `docs/demo-walkthrough.md` — step-by-step SE24 + SICF deployment procedure.
- `packages/core/` — `@zzapi-mes/core` — SAP client (`SapClient`), hub client (`HubClient`), Zod schemas, error types, `ALL_SCOPES` constant. Shared by SDK, CLI, and hub.
- `packages/sdk/` — `@zzapi-mes/sdk` — thin re-export of `@zzapi-mes/core`. Back-compat for existing consumers.
- `packages/cli/` — `@zzapi-mes/cli` — CLI with `--mode direct|hub` flag. Both modes support all commands including write-back (confirm, goods-receipt, goods-issue). Direct mode reads `SAP_*` env or `~/.zzapirc`. Hub mode reads `HUB_URL`/`HUB_API_KEY`.
- `spec/openapi.yaml` — OpenAPI 3.0 contract for SAP + hub endpoints.
- `apps/hub/` — `@zzapi-mes/hub` — Hono server. Holds SAP creds server-side, issues JWTs to clients presenting API keys (SQLite-backed, argon2id-hashed). Deploys as systemd unit or Docker container. Admin CLI: `zzapi-mes-hub-admin keys create/list/revoke`.
- `Dockerfile` — Multi-stage build for the hub. Uses `pnpm prune --prod` in builder, copies `node_modules` to slim runtime.

## Commands

- `pnpm build` — compile core, SDK, CLI, and hub TypeScript packages.
- `pnpm test` — run unit tests across core + hub + CLI (Node built-in test runner, mocked fetch + in-memory SQLite for hub).
- `pnpm spec:gen` — regenerate Zod schemas from `spec/openapi.yaml` via `scripts/spec-gen.sh` (runs openapi-zod-client then strips zodios code and adds `*Schema` re-exportss). CI drift gate checks this.
- `pnpm smoke` — run the curl smoke suite against sapdev. Requires handlers to already be deployed. Override creds/host via env:
  ```
  SAP_USER=api_user2 SAP_PASS='Pt@2026' SAP_HOST=sapdev.fastcell.hk:8000 pnpm smoke
  ```
  Defaults: `sapdev.fastcell.hk:8000`, client `200`. Exits with the number of failed checks.
  Set `VERBOSE=1` to print response bodies on failure.

## Deployment Model (important for edits to `abap/`)

Editing a file in `abap/` **does not deploy it**. The round-trip is manual:

1. Edit ABAP in SE24 on SAP (typically via `msi-1` Parsec/RDP → SAP GUI for Windows; SE24 also works in Java GUI and Web GUI, unlike SE80).
2. Register/activate the service node in SICF (one-time per endpoint, under `/default_host/sap/bc/`).
3. Mirror the activated source back into `abap/<CLASS>.abap` in the repo and diff to catch SAP-side edits.
4. Run `pnpm smoke` to verify.

When adding a new handler class: follow the naming pattern `ZCL_ZZAPI_MES_*`, place the SICF node at `/sap/bc/zzapi_mes_*`, and add a `check` line to `scripts/smoke.sh`.

## ABAP Handler Conventions

Each handler is a single class implementing `IF_HTTP_EXTENSION` with one method `handle_request`:

- Read HTTP method from `server->request->get_header_field( '~request_method' )`.
- Read query params via `server->request->get_form_field( '<name>' )` (plain names, no BSP `pa_` prefix).
- `CASE lv_method` dispatches verbs; unmatched verbs must return `405` with a JSON error body.
- Set status + `content-type: application/json` + `set_cdata()` for every code path (including 404/405).
- Reuse existing SAP artifacts: structure `ZMES001`, serializer `ZZ_CL_JSON` (camelCase mode). Do not reinvent JSON handling.
- Keep the PO JSON for `/sap/bc/zzapi_mes` byte-identical to what the legacy BSP page emits — the smoke test and downstream MES consumers depend on this.

For multi-endpoint routing under one SICF node, dispatch on `server->request->get_header_field( '~path_info' )` inside `handle_request` rather than registering many SICF nodes.

## Hub Architecture

### Middleware Chain (write-back routes)

Write-back routes (confirmation, goods-receipt, goods-issue) pass through:
1. **JWT verification** (`middleware/jwt.ts`) — validates Bearer token, extracts scopes
2. **Scope enforcement** (`middleware/jwt.ts`) — checks required scope (conf/gr/gi)
3. **Idempotency guard** (`middleware/idempotency.ts`) — requires `Idempotency-Key` header, stores SHA-256 body hash in SQLite. Returns:
   - `409` if same key + same body (true duplicate)
   - `422` if same key + different body (hash mismatch)
4. **Rate limiting** (`middleware/rate-limit.ts`) — per-key token bucket
5. **Audit logging** — writes to `audit_log` table via `writeAudit()`

### Scope Definitions

`ALL_SCOPES` in `packages/core/src/index.ts` is the single source of truth: `["ping","po","prod_order","material","stock","routing","work_center","conf","gr","gi"]`. Hub admin CLI and test helpers all import from core.

### Spec Codegen

`spec/openapi.yaml` → `openapi-zod-client` → `packages/core/src/generated/schemas.ts`. The generated file contains zodios code that must be stripped (done by `scripts/spec-gen.sh`). Schema re-exports with `*Schema` suffix are added automatically. **Never hand-edit `schemas.ts`** — always run `pnpm spec:gen`.

### Error Semantics (write-back routes)

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| 201 | Success |
| 400 | Invalid JSON body or missing `Idempotency-Key` |
| 401 | Missing/expired JWT |
| 403 | Insufficient scope |
| 409 | Duplicate idempotency key (same body), or SAP backflush conflict (goods-issue) |
| 422 | Idempotency key reused with different body, or SAP business rule rejection |
| 429 | Rate limit exceeded |
| 502 | SAP upstream error (non-422/409) |

## Phase Roadmap

| Phase | Scope | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Deploy `ZCL_ZZAPI_MES_PING` + `ZCL_ZZAPI_MES_HANDLER`, curl round-trip verified | Pending (SAP GUI) |
| 2 | OpenAPI spec, Node SDK, CLI | Done |
| 3 | Hub with JWT auth, SAP auth abstracted | Done |
| 4 | Persistent API keys, admin CLI, request IDs, logs, metrics, rate limiting, spec codegen, e2e tests | Done |
| 5 | MES business endpoints (5A read + 5B write-back with idempotency/audit) | Done |
